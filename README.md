> ⚠️ **Project Status:** This project is actively under development. Core gameplay and authentication features are functional, but additional enhancements are ongoing.

---

## 📌 Overview

**GameZxne** is a multiplayer gaming backend platform built in **Java** using **Spring Boot**. It supports real-time gameplay using **WebSockets**, secure authentication via **JWT**, and a full REST API for managing users, games, and players.

It is intended to serve as the **backend for a multiplayer Rock-Paper-Scissors game**, with future extensibility for other turn-based games.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- ✅ **User Registration & Login** using JWT
- ✅ **Game Lobby Management** (Create, Join, Update, Delete)
- ✅ **WebSocket Real-Time Messaging** (STOMP over SockJS)
- ✅ **Round-based Game Logic** with Score Calculation
- ✅ **Role-based Access Control** via Spring Security
- ✅ **MySQL Database** managed with Docker Compose
- ✅ **RESTful API** with DTO patterns
- ✅ **Semantic Versioning & GitHub Actions CI/CD**

## 🚀 Setup & Run

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven
- Docker & Docker Compose

### 🐳 Start MySQL with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### ▶️ Run the Application

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Application will start on: `http://localhost:8080`

## 📡 WebSocket Communication

- **Endpoint:** `/ws`
- **Topic Subscription Format:** `/topic/messages/{username}`
- **STOMP Broker:** In-memory
- **Authentication:** JWT token is passed via URL:  
  `ws://localhost:8080/ws?token=YOUR_JWT_TOKEN`

## 🧪 Testing & CI/CD

### ✅ GitHub Actions

- Builds, tests, and runs Maven on every push to `main`
- Launches Dockerized MySQL for integration
- Uses Semantic Release to:
  - Bump version in `pom.xml`
  - Push GitHub release notes

### 🧪 Unit Tests (Planned)

- Will use **JUnit 5** and **Mockito**
- CI step already in place
